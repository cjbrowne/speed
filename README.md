# About Speed

Speed is a car racing game in which the cars are programmed via JavaScript and then raced against each other.
It's 2D, top-down, and very simplistic, as it is a proof of concept for the idea of a game in which you
write AI for self-driving cars to compete against each other in motorsports.

Even still, there are some very interesting problems to solve in this domain, and I cannot solve them all alone.
